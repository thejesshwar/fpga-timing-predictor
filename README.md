## 💡 The Problem
In modern VLSI design, **Static Timing Analysis** is a bottleneck. Chip designers typically wait hours for Synthesis and Place & Route tools just to check if their design meets timing constraints.

## 🛠 The Solution
We built an **AI-Powered EDA Tool** that predicts combinational logic delay in **milliseconds** directly from Verilog RTL code. 

By using a **Physics Informed Machine Learning Engine** this tool identifies architectural bottlenecks without running synthesis, enabling designers to Shift Left and fix timing errors immediately.

## ✨ Key Features
* **⏱️ Zero Synthesis Profiling:** Instant delay prediction vs Hours for standard tools.
* **🧠 Explainable AI:** Uses **LIME** to generate visual charts explaining why a circuit is slow.
* **⚛️ Physics Informed Data:** Trained on a synthetic dataset generated from fundamental circuit delay laws ($Delay \propto Depth + Fanout$) overcoming the scarcity of industrial data.
* **💻 Interactive UI:** A Drag and Drop Web Interface built with **Streamlit**.

## 📊 Validation & Benchmarks
We validated the tool against industry standard benchmarks and varying circuit complexities:

| Circuit | Logic Depth | Predicted Delay | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **ISCAS-85 (c17)** | 6 | **1.98 ns** | ✅ Accurate |
| **4-Bit Adder** | 7 | **2.64 ns** | ✅ Accurate |
| **3-Bit Multiplier** | 10 | **3.67 ns** | ✅ Accurate |

As expected, the tool correctly identifies the Multiplier as the slowest component due to its complex adder tree structure.

### 2. LIME Explainability
The model explains that **Logic Depth** is the dominant factor for the Multiplier's delay:
